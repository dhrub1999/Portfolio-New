## Technologies Used

This portfolio website is built using a stack of modern web development technologies and tools:

### Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a powerful React framework used for building modern web applications. It provides features like server-side rendering, routing, and code splitting out of the box, making it an excellent choice for creating fast and scalable websites.

### Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development. It simplifies styling by providing a set of predefined utility classes that you can apply directly to my HTML elements.

### Supabase

[Supabase](https://supabase.io/) is an open-source alternative to Firebase, providing a suite of tools for building serverless applications. It offers features like database storage, authentication, and serverless functions, all of which can be leveraged to create dynamic web applications.

[Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) is a headless Content Management System (CMS) that empowered me to manage and deliver content to my website. It offers a flexible and customizable content model, making it easy to add, edit, and organize content for my projects and blog posts.

These technologies, when combined, enable the creation of a visually appealing and functionally robust portfolio website that showcases my skills and projects effectively.
